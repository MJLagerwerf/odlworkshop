    "Further, while for this case computing the gradient would be quite simple, once we move to harder and mroe complicated models doing so would be basically impossible to do by hand. To work around this, all major deep learning frameworks implement [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation). This may sound fancy, but automatic differentiation is simply the chain rule for the derivative. Tensorflow implements it using the `tf.gradients` command."
