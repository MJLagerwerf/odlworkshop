    "- The problem is non-linear and quite hard to optimize. A good strategy is required.\n",
    "- The implementation works fine but seems to be quite slow. We should identify the bottlenecks!\n",
    "- To speed things up, in particular later for the derivative and its adjoint, partial computations can be reused. This requires an implementation of the spectral projector as an `Operator` with manual overrides for `derivative` and `adjoint`.\n",
    "- Currently, all energies from 0 to 35 keV are used with equal spacing. We should use less samples in the range after the source intensity peaks.\n",
    "- For an energy-discriminating detector we need to handle the case of multiple energy bins, i.e., assign photon energy subsets to detector bins. This changes the operator structure a bit, but not too much."
